# UserList

A React front end for a basic [Spring Boot REST API](https://github.com/jroundtree/springboot-rest-api-aws).

Complies with Backend for CRUD functionality:

    Create user
    Read user(s)
    Update user
    Delete user

## Hosted

## Installation

Clone this repo, then make sure you have a `.env` file in your project root pointing your environment variable `REACT_APP_USERRESTAPI` to your Spring Boot Application URL. For example, `REACT_APP_USERRESTAPI=http://localhost:8080`.

`npm install` runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

`npm run build` builds the app for production to the build folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

You may serve it with a static server:

```
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```
